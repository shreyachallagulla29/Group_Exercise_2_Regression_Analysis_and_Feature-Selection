This project is all about predicting house prices using machine learning in a structured and easy-to-follow way. It starts by cleaning the dataset handling missing values and outliers and scaling features so everything is on the same level. Then, feature selection is used to focus on the most important factors that actually affect house prices. A Linear Regression model is trained and evaluated using R² Score and RMSE, giving a clear idea of how well it predicts. To make sure the model works well on new data, 5-Fold Cross-Validation is applied, which tests it across multiple splits. Beyond the basics, the project explores ways to improve the model, like experimenting with different feature selection methods, visualizing results with feature importance and residual plots, and trying more advanced models such as Ridge, Lasso, and Polynomial Regression. Throughout the process, clear visualizations and neatly organized notebooks make it easy to follow, understand, and present the results. Overall, this project is a complete walkthrough from preprocessing data to building, evaluating, and improving machine learning models for predicting house prices.
